Anti-Cancer Drug Regimen Experiment on 250 Mice Over 45 Days
After observing the data various conclusions can be drawn from the experiement:


Capomulin, Ramicane, Ceftamin, Infubinol have the lowest SEM, and three of the four are the highest performing regimens, therefore, it is safe to conclude that a lower SEM makes for a more successful drug regimen.

Capomulin & Ramicane are the most successful drug regimens with a tumor volume of 10 less than the two other top four drug regimens (40 vs. 50).

Based on the line plot, tumor volumes increase before making a rapid decease during the duration of the experient. The volume increases during the first third of the time and deceases during the remaining two-thirds of the time frame.

After analyzing the scatter plot, the weight and tumor volume are closely related. As the weight in a mouse increases, the tumor volume also increases. The more a most weighs, the larger the tumor is likely to be.
